# Exercise - Manage users and groups in Microsoft Entra ID

You need to add member user accounts for the new developer team in your organization.

In this exercise, you'll create a new Microsoft Entra organization to hold all of your user accounts. You'll also create a user account, delete a user account, and learn how to recover a deleted user account.



## Add a new user

Now, let's create a user account.

1. In the Microsoft Entra organization you created, in the left menu pane, under **Manage**, select **Users**. The **All users** pane appears.

2. In the top menu bar, select **New user**, then select **Create new user** in the drop-down. The **New user** pane appears for *Contoso Marketing Company*.

3. Enter the following values for each setting.

   **Identity**

   - **User name**: *chris* 
   - **Name**: *Chris Green*

   **Password**

   - Select the **copy** icon next to the autogenerated password and paste the password somewhere you can refer to it later.

4. Select **Review + Create**, then select **Create**. The **All users** pane reappears for *Contoso Marketing Company - Microsoft Entra ID*. The user is now created and registered to your organization.

## Delete a user

You can delete users after they're created.

1. In your **All users** pane for Microsoft Entra organization, from the list, select **Chris Green**.
2. In the top menu bar, select **Delete**. If you don't see that option, select **More**.
3. Select **Ok** to confirm deletion.

## Recover a deleted user

You can restore deleted users. View the list of the deleted users, and then restore one.

1. In your **All users** pane for Microsoft Entra organization, in the left menu pane, select **Deleted users**. You now see all of the users that were deleted within the last 30 days.
2. Check the box next to **Chris Green** and in the top menu bar, select **Restore users**.
3. To confirm, select **OK**. The **All users** pane reappears.
4. Verify that Chris Green's account is recovered by selecting **All users** in the left menu pane. You should see Chris Green restored as a user.



# Exercise - Assign users to Microsoft Entra groups



## Add a new group

   | Setting           | Value           |
   | :---------------- | :-------------- |
   | Group type        | Security        |
   | Group name        | Developer group |
   | Group description | Developer team  |

4. Select **Create**. The **Groups | All groups** pane appears, including the new group in the list of Groups. You might need to refresh to see your new group.
